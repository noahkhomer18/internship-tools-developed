# Vision Impairment Simulator

An interactive web application that simulates various vision impairments to help users understand how different eye conditions affect visual perception. This educational tool provides side-by-side comparisons of normal vision versus impaired vision.

## Overview

The Vision Impairment Simulator is designed to create empathy and understanding for people with visual impairments. Users can select from various vision conditions and see how they affect the perception of everyday scenes and activities.
